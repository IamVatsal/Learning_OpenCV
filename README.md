# Learning OpenCV & Computer Vision

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning OpenCV and other computer vision concepts. Here, I will experiment with image and video processing, face detection, object recognition, and more using Python and OpenCV.

## Structure
- `basic.py`, `draw.py`, `read.py`, `scaling.py`, `videoStream.py`: Python scripts for various OpenCV experiments
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages
- `Resources/`: Contains images and videos for practice
    - `Photos/`: Sample images
    - `Videos/`: Sample videos
    - `Faces/`: Datasets for face recognition tasks

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run any script, for example:
   ```bash
   python read.py
   ```

## Goals
- Learn and practice OpenCV basics
- Explore image and video processing
- Work on face and object recognition
- Document progress and experiments

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or use these scripts for your own learning!
